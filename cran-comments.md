This is a critical update establishing compatability with ggplot/ggtern 3.2.0.

tricolore on CRAN was "archived on 2019-07-03 as check problems were not corrected in time." This update corrects those problems which arose from a change in the way "geom_sf()" expects arguments starting with ggplot 3.2.0.
